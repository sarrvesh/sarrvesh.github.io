Changelog
=========

The latest released version of the cookbook is available `online <http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/lofar/lofar-imaging-cookbook>`_.

This link is advertised on the LOFAR wiki. The very latest (development) version of the cookbook can also be found on the `USG repository <http://usg.lofar.org/svn/documents/trunk/Tutorials/Imaging/>`_.

The LOFAR software is continuously improving and, as a consequence, several procedures (and the cookbook itself) continuously change. In the following, we report an overview of the (recent) changes applied to the manual.

<h1>Data inspection <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-inspection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Data inspection is essential for a proper data reduction and can be carried out using either scripts (by means of a python interface to the Measurement Set) or
<a class="reference external" href="http://casa.nrao.edu/">CASA</a>. In this Chapter, we summarize the various tools that can be used to inspect the LOFAR visibilities at the beginning and during the processing of your data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The program <strong>msoverview</strong> provides you with details on the contents of a Measurement Set, no matter if it is raw or it has been already processed.  You are advised to use this script when you start working on your data. You can run it by typing</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">msoverview</span> <span class="ow">in</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">some</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MS</span> <span class="n">verbose</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">T</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where the <strong>verbose</strong> parameter allows you to have more detailed information about the observation, as the used antennas and their positions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Python-casacore (formerly “pyrap”) is a python interface to the casacore library, which allows the raw data tables (Measurement Sets) to be manipulated and the data plotted via python scripts. These allow you to customize what is plotted, and can be significantly faster than CASA for plotting large datasets. An extensive description of the python-casacore utilities is available <a class="reference external" href="http://casacore.github.io/python-casacore/">online</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Visibilities can be plotted relatively rapidly by making use of the combination of python-casacore and the plotting package PGPLOT, both of which work quickly. The script <strong>uvplot.py</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f2" id="id2">[2]</a> can be used to plot visibility data and can be significantly faster than the PLOTMS task in CASA.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="http://casa.nrao.edu/">CASA</a> is the python-based next generation replacement for AIPS/AIPS++ and can be used to display the data. Be aware that trying to inspect the raw visibilities with CASA will produce a “<strong>segmentation fault</strong>” error. To avoid this, you should make a copy of the dataset with DPPP (see the first example parset in Sect.~ref{theparsetfile}). Moreover, when opening with CASA a MeasurementSet observed between May and October 2011,  you will get an <strong>Unrecognized mount type</strong> error <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f3" id="id4">[3]</a>. CASA has multiple functionalities that allows one to inspect different data products.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>casabrowser</strong> can be used to inspect the content of a Measurement Set.</li>
<li><strong>casaplotms</strong> can be used to visibility data against different parameters.</li>
<li><strong>casaviewer</strong> can be used to inspect images.</li>
<li>For a detailed information and examples of how to use CASA, we direct users to the <a class="reference external" href="http://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page">CASA Guides</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The low frequency radio sky  is dominated by a few bright sources that form the so called A-team: CasA, CygA, VirA, TauA, HydA, HerA. The removal of these sources from the target visibilities is very important in order to achieve high dynamic range images. The script <strong>plot_Ateam_elevation.py</strong>, which is available as part of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lofar-astron/LOFAR-Contributions">LOFAR repository</a>, can be used to inspect the contribution of these A-team sources to the observed visibility data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For manipulating measurement sets, you can use TaQL (Table Query Language); this is an SQL-like language which works on MS, and can perform all kinds of selections (and more). A detailed documentation of TaQL can be found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.astron.nl/casacore/trunk/casacore/doc/notes/199.html">here</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://taql.astron.nl">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the data quality with <strong>aoqplot</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-the-data-quality-with-aoqplot" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have succesfully run DPPP on the measurement sets in your observation, it is recommended that you validate the results of the flagger and get an impression of the quality of the full observation. For this, the <strong>aoqplot</strong> tool that is part of the LofIm build can be used.</p>
<p>Basically, the tool allows you to plot standard deviations and RFI percentages and some other quantities, over time, frequency, baselines and the time-frequency domain of the full observation, i.e., over all sub-bands. Since an observation can be several terabytes of data, the performance of standard tools to perform such analysis is an issue, and the <strong>aoqplot</strong> was designed to overcome this problem. Fig.~ref{aoqplot-window} shows an example of the <strong>aoqplot</strong> interface, plotting the data standard deviations of an LBA set over the entire frequency range. It also allows one to plot differential statistics. “Differential” in this context means that the standard deviation is calculated over the difference between adjacent channels. Therefore, they quantify the noise, because the difference of signal in adjacent (3 kHz) channels is tiny and can be neglected. Differential quantities are prefixed with a “D”, such as DMean and DStdDev.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h3>Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your environment allows (see below), one can get the statistic plots of an observation of a DPPPed set, with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ aoqplot yourobservation.gvds
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The gvds file is given by the observatory and describes the observation, in particular the locations of the measurement sets. The <strong>aoqplot</strong> tool will now connect to all the nodes with an ssh connection, start a bash-session on the node and start a client there that connects back to your node and sends the quality tables. Once all the tables have been received, a window will appear containing the plots. Collecting all the tables takes typically less than 5 seconds.</p>
<p>The use of ssh and bash requires that you should be able to ssh to all the involved nodes without manual intervention, and that the client (called <strong>aoremoteclient</strong>, part of the LofIm daily build) is directly in your bash path after ssh-ing. Thus, after <strong>ssh lof001</strong>, you should be able to start <strong>aoremoteclient</strong> within bash without a <strong>module load lofar</strong>. The easiest way of doing this is by putting <strong>lofar</strong> in <strong>$HOME/.mypackages</strong>. If you have problems running the <strong>aoqplot</strong> due to your environment, please let us know.</p>
<p>When a node is not answering, or there is some error with the measurement set, the set will be skipped, an error will be given describing the problem and the statistics will be collected without those measurement sets. If none of the measurement sets can be queried, you will see a dialog window with many error messages and the window will not appear thereafter. If you can not determine the cause of this, please let us know. The software is currently (January 2012) still experimental.</p>
<p>The <strong>aoqplot</strong> can also be used on individual sub-bands by putting the measurement set filename in the command line, e.g.:</p>

<div class="section" id="analyzing-the-statistics">
<h3>Analyzing the statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-the-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>aoqplot</strong> tool provides the following statistics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Count</strong>: the number of samples that are left after flagging of the data. This should normally be fairly constant over time, frequency and baselines, apart from a few imprints of RFI that lower the number of available samples. Since the flags of the complex values of different polarizations are normally equal, there’s no use in looking at this statistic for polarizations or real/imaginary components indivually.</li>
<li><strong>Mean</strong>: the mean of the data. If you are observing a strong source (such as a calibrator), this value should contain structure over time, frequency and baselines. Note that if you for example plot the mean over time, each sample in the plot shows the mean of that timestep over all baselines and frequencies. Therefore, if your source is not in the phase centre, it will be supressed and can even be averaged out, because sources outside the phase centre contribute sinusoidally and will cancel out. If your source <strong>is</strong> in the phase centre, the Mean is a very good representation of the strength of the signal. Together with an estimate of the noise, this can be used to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio during the observation. If you know the approximate flux density of the source, you can estimate the gain during the observation and, together with an estimate of the noise, calculate a rough estimate of the system noise. Cross polarizations can be checked to see if there was significant differential Faraday rotation during the observation.</li>
<li><strong>StdDev</strong>: the standard deviation of the data after flagging. The standard deviation should not have significant imprints of RFI. In good data, one generally sees about three significant spikes in HBA (in <span class="math">\(\pm\)</span> 115-163 MHz) and zero spikes in LBA (&gt;30 MHz, an example is given in Fig.~ref{aoqplot-window}). The standard deviation is rather sensitive for low-level RFI, and a few RFI spikes do not seem to hurt calibration at this point (please report if you think otherwise). If there are time or frequency ranges at which the standard deviation is significantly different, try to select different polarizations and use the different domains (time-frequency, baseline, time, frequency, …) to see if you can localize the guilty data range. The position of the Sun and the Milky Way in the sky can significantly change the standard deviation. Because the StdDev includes the variance of the signal, it is recommended also to look at the DStdDev.</li>
<li><strong>DCount</strong>, <strong>DMean</strong> and <strong>DStdDev</strong> are similar to the above statistics, but are calculated over the differences of samples (after flagging) in adjacent channels. They contain therefore very little contribution of the signal, and can be used to get an accurate estimate of the noise. They have been normalized to represent the same units as their counterpart values. The DMean should be close to zero, as the signal should be subtracted out, and the noise should average out (it is mainly there because it is easy to calculate, but it is often more helpful to look at Mean and DStdDev).</li>
<li><strong>RFI</strong>: the amount of RFI found by the flagger. The ‘base level’ of RFI is 2–5%, but can contain a few spikes over time or frequency that go up to 20%–100% at times. This is normally not a problem. Sub-bands or stations with significant different RFI levels (either 0% or <span class="math">\(&gt;\sim 5\)</span>%) often indicate an issue with the station. Such problems are often also reflected in the standard deviations. Different polarizations and real/imaginary values have equal RFI ratios.</li>
<li><strong>SNR</strong>: the signal-to-noise ratio. It is calculated by Mean / DStdDev. This value is only accurate if you are observing a source in the phase centre, due to the reasons mentioned in the paragraph for the Mean value.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background-information">
<h3>Background information<a class="headerlink" href="#background-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>aoqplot</strong> tool works together with DPPP. Recent versions (&gt;21 December 2011) of DPPP will add so-called quality statistic tables to a measurement set. These tables circumvent having to read the entire DATA column of a measurement set to get the basic statistics. The way they are stored is described in the quality statistics proposal written by Andr’e Offringa. Because the statistics plotting tool require these tables, you can not directly plot statistics of measurement sets that are averaged by an older DPPP, or have not been averaged at all.</p>
<p>The statistics are calculated individually for the real and complex values. This is not common when treating complex values, but does allow easy interpretation. This means that <span class="math">\(\mu_r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma_r\)</span>, the real mean and real standard deviations respectively, are calculated as:</p>
<div class="math">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\mu_r = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{x\in X} \texttt{real}(x)\\\sigma^2_r = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{x\in X} \left(\texttt{real}(x) - \mu_r\right)^2\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>If you select “amplitude” in the <strong>aoqplot</strong> user interface, the actual plotted quantity is:</p>
<div class="math">
\[|\sigma| = \sqrt{\sigma_r^2 + \sigma_i^2},\]</div>
<p>i.e., the amplitude of the standard deviation of the real and imaginary components, not the standard deviation over the amplitudes. The same holds for the “XX+YY” and “XY+YX” check boxes, which represent the sum of the statistic, not the statistic over the sums.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you want to use <strong>aoqplot</strong>, but do not want to use DPPP to average the data, a different way of adding the required quality statistics to a measurement set is by using the <strong>aoquality</strong> tool, part of the LofIm build. The general usage is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">aoquality</span> <span class="n">collect</span> <span class="n">SB000</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">MS</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <strong>aoquality</strong> also has some options for retrieving statistics on the command line. Run <strong>aoquality</strong> without parameters to get a list of options.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-information-manual-flagging-in-casa">
<h2>Additional information: manual flagging in CASA<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-information-manual-flagging-in-casa" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While manual flagging will not be practical once the pipeline is
completed, during early stages it may be useful to remove remaining
RFI in order to test the calibration or imaging routines.  Flagging tasks in CASA include <strong>FLAGDATA</strong> and <strong>FLAGCMD</strong> for command-line based flagging.  The task <strong>PLOTMS</strong> offers GUI-based flagging.  <strong>PLOTXY</strong> can also be used for manual flagging, but users should be aware that it is being deprecated in favor of <strong>PLOTMS</strong> and may not be available in future releases of CASA.  Once the CASA <strong>PLOTMS</strong> has loaded and data is visible, click the <strong>Mark Region</strong>
button, highlight data that you wish to flag, click the <strong>Flag</strong>
button, and <strong>Quit</strong> once you are finished.</p>
<p>CASA also provides two algorithms, RFLAG and TFCROP, for automatic RFI flagging.  These algorithms are available as options within the <strong>FLAGDATA</strong> task.  For more information on their usage, we suggest users consult Chapter 3 of the latest version of the CASA Cookbook.</p>
<p>Observations at ‘low’ elevation (below <span class="math">\(\sim30^{\circ}\)</span> for Cygnus~A,
and below <span class="math">\(\sim40^{\circ}\)</span> for 3C196) are sufficiently noisy that they
are of limited use. These bad time ranges need to be identified and
removed. This could be done through DPPP, but also by manual flagging
in CASA or using the CASA <strong>SPLIT</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f4" id="id5">[4]</a> task or the python script <strong>split_ms_by_time.py</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#f5" id="id6">[5]</a>. Splitting out part of a MeasurementSet can be done as part of the distributed pipeline and will most likely be necessary until more robust flagging routines are implemented.</p>

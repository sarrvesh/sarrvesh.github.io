Software packages
=================

+ **cuda Fast Faraday Synthesis (cuFFS)** - As part of my PhD, I wrote a GPU-accelerated code to carry out rotation measure synthesis. The code is publicly available on `GitHub <https://github.com/sarrvesh/cuFFS>`_ and has been published `here <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26C....25..205S/abstract>`_.
+ **LOFAR Unified Calculator for Imaging (LUCI)** - I developed and maintain a suite of calculator web applications for LOFAR (`link <https://support.astron.nl/luci/>`_ and `source code <https://github.com/lofar-astron/LOFAR-calculator>`_). 
+ **LOFAR Imaging Cookbook** - I am the current editor of the `LOFAR Imaging Cookbook <https://support.astron.nl/LOFARImagingCookbook/>`_.

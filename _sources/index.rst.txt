I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy working with the MeerKAT radio telescope. 

Previously, I worked at ASTRON as a Telescope Scientist working with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). For my PhD, I studied the non-thermal emission and magnetic fields in nearby galaxies using the LOFAR and the Westerbork radio telescopes.
